# The Language of Lenin

## Description: 

An opinion mining project attempting to see if there is a language characteristic Lenin and to what extent is this language reproduced by its followers. 
I analyze here a collection of *statements* by V.I.Lenin, those are paragraphs written by Lenin and translated into english in order to be published under the name V.I.Lenin.
Those statements were retrived from the "Marxists Internet Archives".

The statements are collected in a JSON file with the following structure: 

```
[{
	"statement": "According to the author’s original plan, the present pamphlet was to have been devoted to a detailed development of the ideas expressed in the article “Where To Begin”, (Iskra, No. 4, May 1901). We must first apologise to the reader for the delay in fulfilling the promise made in that article (and repeated in response to many private inquiries and letters). One of the reasons for this delay was the attempt, undertaken in June of the past year (1901), to unite all the Social-Democratic organisations abroad. It was natural to wait for the results of this attempt, for, had the effort proved successful, it would perhaps have been necessary to expound Iskra’s conceptions of organisation from a somewhat different approach; in any case, such a success promised to put an end very quickly to the existence of the two trends in the Russian Social-Democratic movement. As the reader knows, the attempt failed, and, as we propose to show, was bound to fail after the new swing, of Rabocheye Dyelo, in its issue No. 10, towards Economism. It was found to be absolutely essential to begin a determined struggle against this trend, diffuse and ill-defined, but for that reason the more persistent, the more capable of reasserting itself in diverse forms. Accordingly, the original plan of the pamphlet was altered and considerably enlarged.",
	"is_lenin": 1
}]

In addition there is a random collection of paragraphs **not** written by Lenin including other marxists authors, philosophical texts from the Gutenberg Project, articles from Wikipedia, news resources, erotic websites etc. 

Both collections are of simmilar size.
